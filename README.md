# PluginTemplate
A template Bukkit plugin
This plugin doesn't really do anything, but it provides a nice starting point for developing new plugins.

# Use
* Clone this repo somewhere on your computer.
* update all of the pom.xml, plugin.yml... to reflect your plugins name.
* Modify some stuff! java/main/src is where you want to look :)
* Run Maven install on it! This will generate the plugins jar that you want.
* Push it to a new repo (git remote)
